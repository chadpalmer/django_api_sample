#
To get this running locally on your computer, please run the following commands.

First, in the cmd terminal window, cd to the "django_api_sample" project folder that you cloned from github and then run the following command to set up the Python 3 virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv env
```
Next, activate the new virtual environment by running the following command.
```
source env/bin/activate
```
Next, install libraries and requirements with PIP as follows.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(NOTE: You might need to adjust your project interpreter setting in whatever app you're using to view the code of this projects as it likely defaults to the system 2.7.x version if you are on a Mac.)

If that is the case, you need to change the project interpreter setting to point to the Python 3 installation in your virtual environment. If you followed the instructions here, the interpreter path will be as follows:
```
/<your_folder_path>/django_api_sample/env/bin/python
```
